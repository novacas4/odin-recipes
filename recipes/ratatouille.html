    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by preparing the Piperade for the Ratatouille.
        Cut the bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and ribs.
      </li>
      <li>Heat the oven at 450&#8457;, put the bell peppers with the
        skins up on a trey with aluminium foil. Take them out after
        15 minutes. Once the peppers have cooled, remove the skin
        and cut them into small pieces.</li>
      <li>Cook minced garlic and diced onions in oil till golden.
        It should take &#8776;8 minutes. Next add tomatoes and their
        juices, thyme, parsley and bay leaf. Let it simmer for
        at least 10 minutes until all the juices are absorbed.
        Once finished, add bell peppers and let them simmer for 
        another 5-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove
        the herb's leaves</li>
      <li>While the piperade is prepared, cut all the vegetables.
        To make them the same perfect size, the best way to slice is
        to use a mandoline knife.</li>
      <li>Once both piperade and vegetables are ready, grab a round
        casserole, spread the piparede on the bottom and position the
        vegetables in spirals alternating the colors
        (e.g. zucchini, eggplant, yellow bellpepper, zucchini, eggplant,
        red bellpepperâ€¦etc.). Season with oil, minced garlic, thyme,
        salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat the oven at 275&#8457;. Before putting the casserole
        in, cover the vegetables with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Prepare a vinaigrette with oil, balsamic vinegar, thyme,
        salt, and pepper. Spread the vinaigrette on top before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
