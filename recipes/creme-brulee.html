    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crème brûlée is a classic French dessert consisting of rich, creamy custard with a smooth texture,
      topped with a layer of caramelized sugar that forms a crisp and brittle crust when torched just before serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400ml double cream/heavy cream</li>
      <li>100ml full-fat milk</li>
      <li>1 vanilla pod</li>
      <li>5 egg yolks, large</li>
      <li>50g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>6 tsp of golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to fan 160&#x2103; or conventional 180&#x2103;.</li>
      <li>Place four ramekin dishes (175ml) in a roasting or cake tin at least 7,5 cm deep.
        It needs to be able to allow a baking tray to sit well above the ramekin dishes when laid across the top of the tin.</li>
      <li>Pour the cream and milk into a medium pan. Slice the vanilla pod lengthways through the middle with a sharp knife and split it in two.
        Use the tip of the knife to scrape out all the tiny seeds into the cream mixture. Drop the vanilla pod in as well and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until it turns a pale colour and feels fluffy.
        Put the pan with the cream on medium heat and bring it close to a boil. As soon as you see bubbles appear around the edge,
        take the pan off the heat.</li>
      <li>While continuously stirring with a wire whisk, pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks, and scrape the seeds from the pan.
        Pour the hot mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, including as many vanilla seeds as you can.
        Discard the pale foam on top of the liquid. Stir the mixture in the bowl.</li>
      <li>Pour in enough hot water (tap water is fine) into the tin so that it reaches about 1,5 cm up the sides of the ramekins.
        Pour the hot cream into the ramekins to the top, then put the tin in the oven with a baking sheet over the top.
        It should completely cover them, sitting well over the top. Leave a small gap at one side to allow air to circulate.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until the mixture is softly set.
        They should wobble a bit when you move the tin - don't let them set too firm.</li>
      <li>Lift the ramekins out of the tin and set them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes,
        then put in the fridge to cool completely (you can leave them overnight).</li>
      <li>When you're ready to serve, wipe around the top edge of the dishes, sprinkle 1&frac12; teaspoons of caster sugar over each ramekin.</li>
      <li>Spray with a little water using a fine spray to just dampen the sugar. Next is the enjoyable part: use a blow torch to caramelize it.
        Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until beautifully brown and caramelized.
        If you don't have a blow torch, pop it under a grill (broiler) for a couple of minutes.
      <p>Serve when the brûlée topping is firm.</p></li>
    </ol>
